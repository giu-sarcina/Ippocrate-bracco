# Ippocrate Website

This is the official website for Ippocrate, built using [Bun](https://bun.sh), a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime that combines a package manager, transpiler, bundler, and test runner.

## Getting started

This command installs all project dependencies listed in bun.lockb using Bun's ultra-fast package manager.

```bash
bun install
```

Launches the development server with hot reloading enabled. Ideal for local development and iterative testing.

```bash
bun dev
```

Starts the application in production mode. Ensure all assets are built and optimized before running this.

```bash
bun start
```

# Development Enviornment

For a consistent and containerized development setup, it is recommended to use a .devcontainer configuration (especially with VS Code and GitHub Codespaces).

# Bun Version

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.15.
